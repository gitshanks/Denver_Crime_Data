              <p class="section-subtitle">How different crimes stack up in 2019</p>
            </div>
            <p>Looking at the broad picture of how diffrent crimes stack up over the year by plotting an area graph
              using sequential color ordering for number of crimes, <b>traffic accident was the
                most
                reported crime</b> type over the year with minor monthly variations. This is followed by <b>larceny</b>,
              <b>public-disorder</b> and <b>auto theft</b> as the top crimes. There is a consistent trend of <b>number
                of crimes dipping
                down during winters to spring </b> with a major dip somewhere in January. Whereas the <b>number of
                crimes
                significantly increases when we move to warmer months</b> which is expected. Another interesting finding
              is that the <b>number of reported traffic accidents increased significantly in the winter months</b>,
              starting
              from mid-September all the way to mid-January which is understable attributing to snowy weather.

              <h2 class="section-title">Crime Across Neighborhoods</h2>
              <p class="section-subtitle">Diving in: Most notorious neighborhoods </p>
            </div>
            <p>If we plot the reported incidents of crimes using the geographical coordinates and use sequential color
              encoding along with size to show number of crimes based on different neighborhoods, we end up with a map
              like this. <b>As the color goes from lighter to darker and the size of the circle becomes bigger</b>, it
              corresponds to increasing number of reported crimes. A quick glance at the viz show that <b>five-points is
                the most notorious neighborhood of the city</b>, followed by stapleton and capitol hill. This can be
              attributed to a large number of factors like population, poverty and homelessness. A deeper dive into the
              neighborhood of five-points and seeing factors like <b>most popular crimes, number of precincts, division
                of
                crimes in a precinct will give us a better idea of the crime landscape of the city</b>.

            </div>
            <p>If we take a deeper look at how crimes are distributed throughout the city by <b>color coding the
                different
                types of crime</b> and <b>using circle size an indicator of number of crimes of a specific category</b>,
              we end with
              a
              map like this. Another detail worth noticing in this visualization is that the <b>tool tip shows us the
                number of precincts</b> in a particular area which <b>contextually informs a lot about factors that
                affect the
                crime landscape</b>, as we will discuss in the later visualizations. By observing the visualization, we
              find
              that, when zoomed into <b>five points</b>, the most notorious neighborhood according to our previous
              visualization, <b>traffic accident is the most reported crime</b>, followed by drug alcohol. If we wanna
              see it
              in a better way, let's zoom in a bit further.

            <p>If we plot the number of diffrent crimes happening at five points, and plot them using number of crimes
              per category as the size of the circle. We arrive at the conclusion that the top five crimes happening at
              five points are <b>traffic accident, drug-alcohol, public-disorder, larceny and motor-vehicle theft</b>.
              As observed by the previous visualization, five points have 4 precincts. As we know traffic accident is
              the most reported accident is the most reported crime at five points, let's see how it is distributed
              among the precincts, over the year 2019.

            </div>

            <p>Diving even deeper into studying the crime landscape of five points, <b>we plot the most reported crime
                i.e.
                traffic accident</b> in the neighborhood, <b>divided among the four precincts</b> that make the
              neighborhood,
              <b>throughout the year</b>. This gives us several interesting insights, like <b>September has the most
                number
                of
                reported traffic accidents</b> and the <b>precincts 612, 621 and 211</b> contribute towards <b>majority
                of
                reports</b>. But
              get a better idea of how different crimes are reported at different precincts we might have to take a step
              back and look at the bigger picture including all crimes and not just traffic accidents.

            </div>
            <p>Although traffic accidents, the most reported crime in the neighborhood of five points is a good measure
              to study diffrent precincts, a bigger picture, <b>combining all the crimes</b> that happen in five points
              gives a
              <b>clear understanding of how precincts handle the crimes</b>. The plot of all the crimes over the year
              <b>confirms certain previously observed trends</b>, such as <b>peaking of crimes in warmer months</b> and
              <b>dipping down of crimes in colder months</b>. This look at the bigger picture gives us some <b>pretty
                interesting new insights</b>, which will be really <b>instrumental in understanding how precincts handle
                crimes.</b>
              Precincts <b>211, 621 and 612</b> have the <b>most number of reported crimes</b> in the neighborhood of
              five points. This can
              be <b>attributed to a variety of factors</b> such as <b>population density, shortage of officials, poverty
                etc.</b> An
              imortant way <b>how this insight can be used</b> is that the <b>authorities responsible can mend the
                disparity
                between reported crimes</b> in the neighborhood by <b>focusing more on that specific precinct</b> and
              the <b>effects</b> of
              the solution can <b>trickle down, improving the entire crime landscape of the city</b>.

        <p class="section-subtitle">How crime varies in the most notorious precinct of the city</p>
      </div>
      <p>We further take a closer look of how crime varies in the most notorious precinct of the city, precinct 211. For
        this visualization, <b>we take the five most reported crimes</b> from our Types of Crime visualization namely
        traffic
        accident, drug-alcohol, public-disorder, larceny and motor-vehicle theft. We then plot these against the
        reported date to get an idea how they vary across the year. Few interesting insights to deduce are, exactly as
        expected both <b>traffic accident and motor-vehicle theft peak in mid-August and usually stay high in the warmer
          months and dip in the colder months.</b> Another really important insight is that the <b>public disorder and
          larceny
          also have comparable number of reports as traffic-accident</b> and that's something the concerned city
        authorities
        can work on curbing at the root level. <b>Drug-alcohol related reports see an up-down throughout the year</b>
        and
        that's something worth nothing and needs attention throughout the year.
