<h1>Denver Crime Data</h1>


<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This is study deals with diving down into crimes happening in the City and County of Denver, how it is divided by neighborhoods, time of the year and number of the precincts in that area. We gather a combination of visualizations, start from a broad view of the city and slowly start diving deeper into the city by looking at most notorious neighborhood and the most notorious precinct and how these connect and give insights like how crime varies across the year and how public authorities can curb crime through focusing on a single precinct and effects trickling down from there. <p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Starting from looking at a broader view of how the crime landscape of the city looks and then slowly moving deeper while isolating certain important findings as we from city to neighborhoods, to precincts and then to specific crimes. The most common theme across the whole journey is that crimes usually happen at a high rate in warmer months and dip down in colder months and that traffic accident is the most reported crime. But by far the most important insight such a journey gives is how to tackle a crime at it's very root by employing measures that curb that specific crime at the precinct level and let the effects trickle down through the entire system or city.<p>
